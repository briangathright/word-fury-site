			This game is very similar to the one above. Except it has better graphics and minimal sound effects. It has no scoring system. It still uses lives and for each life lost it becomes easier to lose another as the death zone increases in size. It also has no level up system or difficulty setting. Our game has a different scoring system.

			Falling Words : powertyping

			<a href = "http://www.powertyping.com/trees.shtml"> http://www.powertyping.com/trees.shtml
			</a><br>
			This one has no sound and minimal graphics. It does have a high scores feature. It has word categories and difficulty settings (all speed based). You lose in a similar way to the one above where each missed word increases the danger zone.<br><br>

			Our scoring system is based on speed whereas this game scoring is based on words length mostly. Additionally, our leveling system will feature harder words as well as other difficulty enhancers such as faster falling speeds, color changing words, moving words (left-right, spinning etc.) as well as obstacles that obscure words. Additionally, we will have a high scores system that tracks the best players. We will also have sound effects / music and more advanced art. As well as other features such as power ups, jumbled words, etc.

			We originally planned on naming our game Word-Rage; however we found a word game with the same name already existed. Therefore we changed the name of our project to Word Fury. The game itself is in a different category (it is a word building/puzzle game)
